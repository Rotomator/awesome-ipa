Screen Scraping is an important part of data migration and integration scenarios. It enables modern apps to talk with legacy apps that do not offer an API and is the complement to the data entry side of automation. There are so many technologies available to create user interfaces on Windows desktopâ€”from the old DOS console apps, the Win32 and FoxPro apps of the 1990s, to the Java and .Net Winforms apps of early 2000, to modern WPF apps 

today. Then, there are the web apps of all the different browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome, Flash and Silverlight web technologies, as well as enterprise apps, such as SAP, Siebel, and PeopleSoft, and the good old mainframe with the green screen and terminal emulators. All of these apps can be published via Citrix/VDI. UiPath is providing the first 100% accurate, extremely fast screen scraping tool.

### How does it work?

#### Screen scraping for any  
business scenario

Screen scraping comes to the rescue in many business scenarios. All too often, the only way to retrieve your data is by scraping the UI of another app. Even if you have access to the database, it is sometimes more convenient and less error-prone to go directly through the user interface.

Since 2004, UiPath has been used by more than 1,000 companies for document management and imaging, enterprise application integration, content migration, desktop analytics, business IT process automation, application integration, legacy modernization solutions, mobile enablement of desktop apps, and medical record scraping.

### A hyper productive IDE

UiPath Studio gives you a full-featured integrated development environment (IDE) that enables you to visually design an automation workflow with a drag-and-drop editor. Hundreds of predefined automation blocks are available. The **Recorder** lets you capture the steps of a manual task, and during this recording, your actions on the screen are observed and translated into logical steps in a workflow. At the same time, the **Screen Scraper Wizard** and the **Web Scraping Wizard** allow you to get the data out of any application in mere minutes.

### 100% accuracy in under 16 milliseconds

* * *

UiPath has pioneered the screen scraping of running desktop apps with 100% accuracy in under 16 milliseconds. Prior to UiPath, screen scraping had a low accuracy rate and was slow and fragile. UiPath features an innovative technique for extracting text from running apps, even if they are hidden or covered by another app. Web scraping is a prime feature of the screen-scraping landscape, as there are dedicated methods for extracting pattern-based data that span on multiple web pages.
