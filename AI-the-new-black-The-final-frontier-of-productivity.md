Artificial Intelligence appears to be the new holy grail or the “new black” of automation, as it was described by UiPath’s Chief Robotics Officer, Boris Krumrey, at the 8th NASSCOM GIC Conclave 2017. 


正如 UiPath 的 Boris Krumrey 2017年在第八届 NASSCOM GIC Conclave 大会上所描述的那样，人工智能似乎成为了自动化领域的一匹黑马。

这场定义数字化劳动力的运动在过去几年里发展迅猛，将AI和认知能力整合到RPA 平台中去是进一步提高员工生产力和效率。企业纷纷开始拥抱 RPA 所能提供的巨大潜力，但要整合和应用像 AI 这样革命性的技术则完全是另外一件事。

The quest for defining digital labor has been gaining speed during the past couple of years and integrating AI and cognitive capabilities to an RPA platform is the next step in the quest for increasing the productivity, agility, and efficiency of human workers. Businesses have already tapped into the immense potential that RPA has to offer, but adopting and integrating something as revolutionary as AI is a completely different story. 

本文旨在阐述如何实现 AI 赋能的数字化劳动力，主要的挑战有哪些，以及那些企业和个人如何来保证应用和实施这样的技术。

This paper aims to identify how AI-powered digital labor could be implemented, what the main challenges are, and how both companies and individuals can properly prepare to ensure these technologies are successfully deployed.

## 什么是数字化劳动力 DIGITAL LABOR EXPLAINED 


自动化并不是个新鲜的概念。长久以来，人类社会第一次提到它是在荷马的《伊利亚特》(Homer’s Iliad) ,已经有上千年的历史。它的含义在于使用工具来提升人类的力量和生产力，从那时到现在，并没有发生太多的变化。

Automation is not a modern concept. Historically, it has been a part of the society for thousands of years, being first mentioned in Homer’s Iliad. Its main meaning, that of using tools to increase human power and productivity, has not changed dramatically from then to now. 

差异在于这些工具的原理：期初是由人来驱动的(车轮、杠杆等等)，后来有了靠自然物体驱动的(水轮、风车等等)，再后来的工业革命的机器(蒸汽机、机械设备等等)。现如今，自动化是通过软件编程实现的机器人来完成重复性的、基于规则的工作，我们称之为RPA（机器人流程自动化）。


The difference consists of the way in which these “tools” work: it all started from those powered by humans (the wheel, the lever, etc.), to those powered by natural elements (waterwheels, windmills, etc.) to the machines of the Industrial Revolution (steam engines, mechanical machines etc.). Now, we are at a stage where automation is coded in software robots that perform repetitive, rule-based tasks through a technology called Robotic Process Automation (RPA).


自动化会不断的演化，当然并不会止步于RPA。人工智能将成为构建数字化劳动力的关键因素。人工智能已经被集成到诸如机器学习、认知和计算机图形学、对话技术、人机交互、数据分析、网络安全、IOT、RPA等领域。然而，在将来所带来的后果并不会存在那么强的攻击性。

Automation is constantly evolving and does not stop at RPA. Artificial Intelligence could potentially be a key element in creating digital labor. It has already started to be integrated into areas such as machine learning, cognitive and computer vision, conversational technologies, human-to-machine user interfaces, predictive data analytics, RPA, cybersecurity, IoT or intelligent monitoring. Nevertheless, its effects are not as invasive as they might potentially be in the future.

尽管RPA才刚刚日趋成熟，将AI技术应用到 RPA就形成真正的数字化劳动力，将能完成那些典型的需要知识劳动者的任务。囊括了AI、RPA和其他认知工具的诸如IPA智能流程自动化的应用程序来提升生产力。AI 将成为数字化劳动力“思考能力的”部分。AI会调用RPA,RPA完成工作流程、API、计算机操作脚本、机械式机器人等的操作。


Even though RPA is only now starting to mature, adding AI to it will allow the creation of a true digital workforce that will automate activities typically characteristic to knowledge workers. An application such as Intelligent Process Automation converges AI, RPA and other cognitive tools to enhance productivity. The quality of work will provide service continuity and availability, and will reduce costs. AI will be responsible for the “thinking” component of the digital workforce. It will create the new rules for machine learning and will perform supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and unsupervised learning. AI will trigger RPA, which will be handle workflows and APIs, computer command scripts and mechanical robotics.


因此，RPA扮演的是其中执行的部分。其他组件诸如计算机视觉、非结构化数据或数据模型则扮演的是感知的部分。如下图所示，所有这些数据喂给 AI,完成整个闭环。

关键的一点是AI 本身无法工作。它就像是大脑一样，没有手和腿是不行的。要释放它的潜力，AI 需要 RPA。

The key aspect is that AI cannot function on its own. It would be like a brain without the arms or the legs. To deliver at its full potential, AI needs RPA.

然而，我们离理想中的数字化劳动力还离得很远。当下，人工智能就像是正在学习新技能的一个小工具，并不能带来多大的改变。一两年后，AI会更成熟，将可以做一个认知助手，与人类进行交互，处理非结构化数据。三到五年里，AI将拥有自己的身份。届时AI 将拥有自我学习的能力，能够完全地完成特定的任务。对于自动化来说，将在人类允许的某个程度下独立存在。



Nevertheless, we are still far from achieving fully fledged digital labor. Now, Artificial Intelligence acts as an smart tool that acquires new skills, but without providing a lot of change. In one to two years, AI will be in a more advanced stage and will act as a cognitive assistant, interacting with and servicing humans, and processing unstructured data. In three to five years, AI will have an identity. It will gain true self-learning capabilities and will be fully adaptable to perform reliably specific tasks. In terms of autonomy, it will be independent at a level permitted by a human. AI IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES There is an actual paradox in terms of trusting and controlling an AI solution. There is a constant struggle between retaining control of the AI and trusting its autonomy because humans want it to be highly predictable. An employee can be trusted to perform as expected by trying to train him or her to deliver results as a robot and by doing personal performance controls. But how do humans trust a robot or any automated process, for that matter, to perform as expected?


## AI IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES


对于信任和控制AI是存在潘多拉盒子的。也就是说在对AI保持绝对的控制权和完全信任它之间一直有争议，因为人们总是希望AI的行为是高度可预测的。

There is an actual paradox in terms of  trusting and controlling an AI solution.There is a constant struggle between retaining control of the AI and trusting its autonomy because humans want it to be highly predictable.

人们往往会信任自己的员工，培训他们来拿到一些结果，通常也会有一些个人行为的管控。但要人们相信一个机器人或者任何一个自动化的流程完成它们想要的结果会怎么样呢？

An employee can be trusted to perform as expected by trying to train him or her to deliver results as a robot and by doing personal performance controls.But how do humans trust a robot or any automated process, for that matter, to perform as expected?

首先有一点是诸如像 UiPath之类公司开发的 RPA 机器人和基于AI的机器人之间是存在差异的。因为 RPA机器人是通过编程来完成特定的任务，而AI的机器人是通过自己观察训练得到的。相信算法已经不再是一个问题，眼下是要不要相信一个机器。把AI机器人看作是一个可以和人类一样智能地应对异常和正常情况是其中的关键。信任 AI机器人需要时间并且需要实施过程中的透明性以及分析数据。找到一个可以帮助人类观察机器如何学习以及使用学习到的知识、做出正确的决策的方法绝非易事。

For one, there is a difference between an RPA robot, as one of those developed by UiPath, and a robot as an AI solution. While the RPA robot is programmed to perform certain tasks, the AI solution is trained by observation. It is no longer a question of trusting an algorithm, but of trusting a machine. Treating the AI solution as a machine that acts as a human to react intelligently to exceptions or unexpected changes is key. Trusting AI machines will take time and requires transparency and analytics right from the implementation get go. Finding a transparent method that helps humans observe how the machines learn and use the knowledge the correct way and take the right decisions will be no easy feat. 

除了信任之外，另外一个需要考虑的因素是实施人工智能的过程就是设计最佳的激励体系。存在三种潜在的解决思路：放弃激励体系则需要大量的数据和时间来

Besides trust, another challenge to take into consideration when implementing Artificial Intelligence is devising the best reward system. There are three possible solutions for this issue: giving up the reward system—which would require a lot of data and time, creating a processspecific reward system or implementing a human supervision system. On the one hand, there isn’t any general reward system that can be applied to any situation. There are general rules, but the reward system needs to be very specific to the process it is applied to. The process-specific reward system could potentially allow the AI system selftrain within 48 hours. 

On the other hand, with human supervision, the system will need a lot more time until it learns how to act. Next, there is the matter of properly implementing AI to make it efficient. 

## Understanding that preparation and time are fundamental to successfully implementing AI is key. 

In terms of doing a business and process analysis, there needs to be an understanding of what processes can be automated using AI and RPA, because not all of them are suited to be automated. 

Then, enterprises must set up target operating models that define the organizational change, implementation and communications plans that allow engaging with the key subject matter experts. They have to devise governance programs, manage communication to key stakeholders, define the right working methods, and track progress and transformation KPIs. 

Next, organizations must define and implement the technology integration and infrastructure provision plans, as well as the robotic user authorizations. Finally, setting up Centers of Excellence (CoEs) in charge of implementing and managing automation as quickly and as efficiently as possible is also essential.

## AI OPERATING CHALLENGES 

Organizations need to realize that fear of change and lack of personal employee motivation are real and can impact adopting automation successfully. Artificial Intelligence must not be viewed as a threat or as taking away work, but as a means for being more productive and for tapping new capabilities.

Other major risks reside in operating AI. Training can either take too long or can be too complex, and there is the fear that the technology cannot be trusted and controlled, as well as not knowing the full impact of AI taking the wrong decision. Furthermore, AI capabilities can potentially be too narrow or too specialized to cover the full complexity of a human knowledge employee. Other challenges reside in defining who is responsible, from a legal standpoint, when AI causes damage due to bad decision-making and integrating AI in countries that, from a cultural standpoint, are less risk-averse or that view AI as a threat to their social status. 

Finally, but just as important, a proper training of the AI system takes time and responsibility. Organizations must keep an eye on value misalignment.

Training the AI system common sense to prevent it from taking fatal decisions is ultimately detrimental. 

As seen in the previous illustration, operating Artificial Intelligence could function with the collaboration between the in-house Center of Excellence, AI and robotics consultants, developers and users.

The CoE records and defines new activities and sends them to the consultants or developers, while it also agrees to the design change with users and provides support. 

Consultants or developers create, change and test the platform’s functions and integrations, perform a joint functional test and maintain the AI system platform. The users specify the process changes or the knowledge items and then verify them.

## A FEW FINAL WORDS… 

A mix of AI and RPA, along with a full cooperation with humans is inevitable. But the organization must not take its success for granted. To fully benefit from the limitless potential of the future digital labor, enterprises need to grant its development and adoption the right amount of time, attention, analysis, preparation and thought.

If the Human-to-Machine conundrum is solved, applying AI to countless business processes will become simpler and faster, and it will be easier to accelerate and automate the transformation process.
