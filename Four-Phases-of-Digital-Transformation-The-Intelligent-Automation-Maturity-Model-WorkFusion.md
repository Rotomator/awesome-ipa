As  Intelligent Automation  begins to mature, larger  patterns around implementation are starting to  emerge. We’re learning that in order for a digital  transformation to be successful, there’s a need  for certain program management and technical  competencies. These competencies include use case  selection, data privacy controls reducing the total cost  of ownership, and more, as the IA experience widens. We benchmarked four stages of maturity that are  relevant for most organizations. We have identified  the programmatic competencies required to support  each stage, and beyond, to help you move seamlessly  through the continuum. But, due to the nascent nature of Intelligent  Automation, its maturity is not linear. As you examine  the components of each stage, you may find that you  have skipped to certain enablers without a clear sense of what’s next. Our aim is to provide a 10,000 foot view of these  stages. We hope it will help you assess gaps and spot  potentially missed opportunities along the way


Client lifecycle by maturity stage

Best practices for scaling Intelligent Automation — seen through the lens of WorkFusion’s Maturity Model program 

Early stage
Still evaluating tools/use cases and strategic fit within the organization; actively pursuing POC/pilot
PROGRAMS

Use case identification:
Identifying the right starting point
Typically, this is where most implementations should start. Identifying the right (or wrong) use case is the first step towards understa
nding how to apply the chosen automation tool. This process is typically refined multiple times to ensure the right fit. 

Change management #1:
Planning for the six pillars
The implementation of Intelligent Automation is considered a transformation, which differs greatly from BAU change management.  
Therefore, it’s necessary to apply additional planning and implementation tools in order to ensure the smoothest transition 
possible. The first stage is examining the potential of the change. 

Operations & IT strategy:
Developing an initial infrastructure platform When we first start testing the functionality of the tool, large scale 
infrastructure acquisitions are unnecessary. Early POCs and pilots generally do not require large-scale installations up front. You just need 
to be able to support the production load for a few use cases in order to gauge what’s necessary for scaling.

Automation Delivery Methodology #1: 
Identifying the right delivery method Although we recommend that organizations focus on applying Agile and Scrum to project long-term delivery, early delivery methodologies 
typically lean Waterfall. Though this is the most widely used project management style for enterprise software delivery, Waterfall tends to 
lengthen timelines for automation, and deliver sub-par products. We recommend that you explore different methodologies and delivery 
centers at this time in order to plan for the road ahead

Mid-stage
At least one use case actively in production

PROGRAMS

Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) #1:
Identifying the initial costs and benefits of your program Your initial use cases will help you extrapolate high level costs in the first 
year of your program.  This process will be scaled and refined post Book of Work planning.

WorkFusion Lean #1:
Optimization basics and gap assessment Intelligent Automation (IA) means that business processes are automated by mimicking human actions via the application user 
interfaces they use. This presents unique opportunities for you to optimize those processes prior to automating them. The WorkFusion 
Lean Program gives you a basic understanding of best practices for reengineering processes prior to automation.

Book of Work Planning:
Scaling across multiple businesses and timelines Initial use case identification can only take your vision so far.  To get the 
enterprise-grade benefits of IA, you will need to perform large-scaling book of work modeling across multiple businesses and/or timelines. This 
will provide line of sight into your pipeline, and also act as a primary input into your second-stage CBA exercise.

Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) #2: 
Identifying the right delivery method Waterfall is the most typical early delivery methodology.  However, we recommend that you explore different methodologies at this time 
in order to get ready for the road ahead.

Automation Delivery Methodology #2 or #3:
Setting up your factory or augmenting your CoE
Whether your company has a mature Center of Excellence (CoE) framework (#2), or you are setting up a factory up for the first time (#3), 
this is where your methodology moves from tactical program and project management to decision-making about delivery and centralization. 


Growth stage 
Multiple disjointed use cases in production lacking enterprise cohesiveness

PROGRAMS

WorkFusion Lean #2:
Advancing reengineering techniques as part of your IA footprint Work Fusion Lean’s Practitioner Program offers the guidance you need if 
your organization does not have a formal Lean structure, or if you want to augment your existing practices with an optimization protocol that is 
specifically geared toward IA.

Power User Program #1:
Assessing how to scale and reduce costs
As you grow, the total cost of ownership will adjust downward considerably over time. But that will only happen if you leverage the 
tool’s ability to be configured by non-technical staff.  We call these citizen developers Power Users, and this is the right time to start 
identifying them.

Scaling IT:
Expanding your infrastructure to support your incoming productions
Building the appropriate infrastructure can begin as early as Mid-Stage, but we often find that expansion is best executed in the Growth 
Stage.  At this point, you have learned enough to be able to make decisions that significantly impacts cost, such as on-premise versus cloud.

Change Management #2:
Reading the organization for transformation
As you embrace the full capabilities of Intelligent Automation, you will do business in a new way. This will impact every business, every customer, 
and every employee in your company. Typically, this is the stage when your Change Management plans are ready for execution.

Power User Program #2
Setting up the factory or CoE 2.0 
Toward the end of the Growth Stage, you will start transitioning developers and power users.  As IA best practices get more widespread 
in the marketplace, you may be able to do this at an earlier stage. But, it is essential to “work out the kinks” before distributing this technology as 
an end user computing tool (EUC)


Mature stage 
Centralized program ready to scale

PROGRAMS

Portfolio Management Best Practices

Advancing from KPIs to business intelligence

Once your program moves into maturity, overall refinements, shifts, and digital transformation will occur on a scale that requires you to 
apply enterprise-wide intelligence.  We recommend getting ahead of dashboard standardization to be ready to connect to broader big data 
visuals and reporting.

Modernize IT
Implementing the newest and best
As technology changes, so do the available options for IA support. At this point, your organization may move to a Cloud platform, or even 
IA as a service. 

Ad Hoc Thought Leadership
Reaching into your network for new ideas
When you reach maturity, you are ready to really scale. That means that your business is ready to perform in a new way. This presents an 
opportunity to reach out into a more mature network to leverage the best practices of others. Implementing a veteran approach, or using 
it to validate your own, is a necessary final step in becoming an IA BAU Enterprise
